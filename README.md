# Estrelaetal2021_FunctionalAttractors
Data files and R scripts used to generate the figures for Estrela et al (2021) Functional attractors in microbial community assembly.

The 16S rRNA sequencing abundance data is available at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5x69p8d3z and can be found in the data/data_main folder.

Each script in the Rscripts_figs folder generates:

- pdf file with plot (saved in Rplots folder);
- csv file with data figure (saved in data/data_figures folder).

Code for the FBA simulations can be found at https://github.com/vilacelestin.
